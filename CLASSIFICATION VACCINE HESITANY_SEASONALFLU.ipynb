   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Vaccination has greatly improved public health, yet vaccine skepticism is causing immunization rates to decline. This trend prompted research into vaccination attitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amid this, flu vaccine hesitancy is a major concern, hindering efforts against seasonal flu outbreaks. Despite the flu causing millions of hospitalizations and 52,000 deaths annually, only 51.4% received the vaccine in the 2021-22 season. Hesitancy leads to disease spread, strains healthcare, and may cause co-infections, causing economic burdens and disrupting daily life.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt flu vaccination is crucial, especially during fall and winter when flu and COVID-19 can spread together. It reduces co-infection risk and eases healthcare strain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flu vaccine hesitancy is driven by factors like misinformation, safety fears, beliefs, and access. Understanding these helps design effective interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ministry of Health assigned us to address flu vaccine hesitancy. Our study uses machine learning to predict flu vaccine likelihood. By analyzing data, we empower experts to understand low vaccination rates and overcome barriers. This bridges the gap between hesitancy and effective interventions, creating a healthier community\n"

    " * The columns employment_occupation, employment_industry, and health_insurance have the most missing values, at 50.4%, 49.9%, and 46.0% respectively. However, it is important to note that some of these missing values are not due to respondents declining to answer, but rather because they are not applicable. For example, 10,231 respondents who are classified as 'Not in Labor Force' have missing values for employment_occupation and employment_industry. Similarly, 1,453 unemployed respondents have missing values for these columns. In these cases, it is more appropriate to consider employment_occupation and employment_industry as 'not applicable' rather than missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are also evident patterns in missing values. For example, respondents who declined to answer about one aspect, such as whether their doctor recommended a specific vaccine, often did the same for other related questions. This trend was also observed for questions regarding chronic medical conditions, having a child under 6 months, being a health worker, opinion questions, income, education, personal and home life questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These patterns suggest that treating missing information for certain variables as a distinct category rather than dropping it altogether may be more meaningful. This is because it appears to represent a specific type of respondent that constitutes a noteworthy portion of the sample population\n",

    "The Naive Bayes classifier demonstrated a balanced performance on the test dataset. It exhibited relatively good precision for classifying individuals who did not get vaccinated (0.81) and satisfactory precision for those who did (0.67). It effectively identified a significant proportion of vaccinated individuals (recall of 0.82) while maintaining reasonable recall for non-vaccinated individuals (0.65). The F1-scores for both classes were comparable (0.72 for non-vaccinated and 0.74 for vaccinated), indicating a harmonious trade-off between precision and recall. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively predicting the vaccination status for the majority of instances.

    " - **Enhance Public Awareness Regarding Vaccine Effectiveness**: Efforts should focus on increasing public knowledge about the vaccine's effectiveness in safeguarding against the flu. These awareness initiatives could be executed at the community or national level. Disseminating credible evidence through channels like television or online advertisements can facilitate informed decision-making. Simultaneously, there's an opportunity to underscore the vaccine's safety, which is a pivotal factor in predicting vaccination status. This can be especially crucial when contrasting the vaccine's safety with the potential risks of contracting the seasonal flu.\n",

    "- **Encourage Regular Physician Recommendations**: To bolster herd immunity, it is advisable for healthcare providers to consistently advise their patients to undergo seasonal flu vaccination annually. This personalized approach may yield better results compared to generalized vaccine promotion through alternative means. Nonetheless, comprehensive campaigns remain vital for reaching individuals who may not have routine access to healthcare services.\n",
